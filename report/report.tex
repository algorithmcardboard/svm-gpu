\section{Abstract}
This project is an attempt to implement the Support Vector Machine classifier using GPUs.
We tried two approaches: 
The first one is to try to port the Sequential Minimal Optimization part to the GPU\@.
The second one is to implement the gram matrix calculation to GPUs.
We end up using the second approach and we show show performance improvements over the conventional approach used by libsvm. 
\section{Introduction}
What is the problem you are trying to solve? Why is it important? What are your contributions?
\section{Background Information}
You can put here any needed background information about the problem at hand and any domain-specific knowledge.
\section{Literature Survey}
Previous work in this problem and what are the pros and cons of each solution.
\section{Proposed solution}
\section{Experimental Setup}
Specs of the machine, problem size, etc.
\section{Experimental Result \& Analysis}
What are your findings. I expect much deeper description that ``As we can see X is better than Y''.
\section{Conclusions}
What are your main findings? Can you generalize them?
